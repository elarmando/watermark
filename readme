    This code is to resolve a challenge proposed on this video:

    The challenge is to remove the watermarks from some famous cartoons of the world chess championship in 1972 (fischer vs spassky).
    You can download the images from here:

    Manuel Lopez Michelone (La morsa) made a first implementation that you can find here:

    http://la-morsa.blogspot.com/2013/05/quitando-la-marca-de-agua.html

    This implementation follows these steps:

    1) Find the pixels that are not gray (isPixelWaterMark2 function)
    2) for each pixel channel applied the reverse transformation
        r = Math.round((r1 - (c2 * 41)) / c1);
        g = Math.round((g1 - (c2 * 15)) / c1);
        b = Math.round((b1 - (c2 * 19)) / c1);

        where r1, g1, b1 are the original red, green and blue values in the image that are not gray.
        c1 = 0.7, and c2 = 1 - c1 (c1 is the percentage of the original image without watermark)

        r,g, b are the new values

        the constant values 41, 15, 19 are assumptions that the color of the wartermark is rgb(41,15,19)

    3) Finally, the new pixel value is the average of rgb (grayVal = (r + g + b) / 3)
